Everything ML related <br> 
Mostly contains works accomplished in 2024 Spring offereing of ES 335: Machine Learning under Prof. Nipun Batra, IIT Gandhinagar, as parts of multiple assignments. <br>
Major works include:<br>
1)  Human Activity Recignition (HAR) based on extracted temporal features using decision trees.
2)  Attempt Super-resolution and Image Reconstruction using Linear Regression and its variants.
3)  [Very Basic Next Character Predictor and Time Series Forecaster using MLPs](https://github.com/Robohrriday/ML_2024_TensionFlow_A3)

Note: All this was done in a team and not single-handedly
